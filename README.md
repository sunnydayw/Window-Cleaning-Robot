Calibration is necessary for the ﬁrst use of the ESC, or whenever used with a new/different transmitter. Individual transmitter's signals for full throttle, fuII brake and neutral vary. You must calibrate your ESC so that it will operate more effectively with your transmitter.
How to calibrate the ESC?
1.ESC switch OFF.
Connect the ESC to the battery and the motor.
Turn on the transmitter.
 Press and hold the ESC switch for few seconds, the motor will ring long beep once. After that, the red LED will blink the motor will ring like beep-beep-beep... in a row which indicates it is time to set the neutral position, full throttle and full brake one by one. You could release the ESC switch now.
  Keep the throttle trigger in neutral position, press the ESC switch once, the green LED will blink once then extinguish and the motor will ring beep once which indicates the neutral position has been set.
  Hold full throttle and press the ESC switch once, the green LED will blink twice then extinguish and the motor will ring twice like beep-beep which indicates the full throttle has been set.
  Move the throttle trigger to full brake and hold full brake, press the ESC switch once, the green LED will blink three times then extinguish and the motor will ring three times like beep-beep-beep which indicates the full brake has been set.
  After the calibration is ﬁnished, keep the throttle in neutral position, the red LED will stay ON, the ESC and the motor is ready to work
